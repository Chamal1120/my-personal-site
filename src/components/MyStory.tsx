        After finishing my school I started working in a local computer shop
        where I got the opportunity to play with various bugs and problems
        which let me expand my knowledge on computer hardware and software
        in an unimaginable way. I had access to laptops, motherboards, and
        other parts from 90s to 2020 (latest at that time) to play and enhance
        my knowledge. This is where my passion for computers ignited and
        Forever thankful to "Nex Computer" and it's owner Mr.Anjana Tharaka
        for giving me that opportunity and training.

        But I wanted more, After quiting the job there I persuaded a computer
        science degree to properly learn and understand computers and
        software engineering. There  I learned a lot of Math, programming,
        OS concepts, machine learning, industry standards and many other
        things. Got a lot of fun with friends too btw ðŸ˜„.

        For my college work, I bought a used Macbook (very cheap one) as I only
        had experience with Windows and wanted see other paradiagms. I was
        introduced to Unix with MacOS and fell in love with it. I got obseessed
        with the terminal, vim, tmux, bash and gnu-coreutils and wanted try
        Linux for a more pure Unix experience.

        I did have some experience with Ubuntu and Mint from childhood days
        never liked them as it was hard to play Windows games or run other
        applications I wanted (I didn't know how set up wine ðŸ˜…). But this time I dived in as a
        programmer. I installed Arch Linux to my Macbook in 2024 and never looked
        back to this date. It was THE BEST DECISION I EVER TOOK IN MY LIFE.
